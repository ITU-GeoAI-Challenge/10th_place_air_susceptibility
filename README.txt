Thank you for this amazing challenge.

This readme.md shows the steps to run the codes and get a reproducible result.

All you need to do is run the 'code.ipynb' notebook which is in this current directory as the readme.

After running the code, you should get an output which is 'sub.csv' which houses the results/submission.

Thank you.
